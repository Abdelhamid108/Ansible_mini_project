# Apache HTTP Server Installation and Configuration Playbook
- name: Install and configure Apache on RHEL-based servers
  hosts: all                  # Targets all hosts in inventory (filter with --limit if needed)
  gather_facts: no            # Explicitly disables fact gathering for performance
                              # Note: Ensure 'apache' role doesn't require gathered facts
  roles:
    - apache                  # Reference to the apache role containing all installation 
                              # and configuration tasks for httpd service

  # Recommended execution:
  # ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml --limit "rhel_servers"
  # To target only RHEL-based systems from your inventory
